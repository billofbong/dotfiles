# dotfiles
This repository is a personal location for me to store my dotfiles, so it's easy to set up any new machine I use.

If you want to use them, feel free. Clone this repo, then `sudo ./activaate.sh`. 

If you want to use one or the other, use `stow vim` or `stow bash`. Keep in mind, though, that my vim setup requires some additional installations, like nodejs and curl (which doesn't come with Ubuntu for some reason). The nodejs version must be >= 14.
